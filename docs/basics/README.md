# Basics

The following articles cover the basics of installing and using Garden:

* Installation instructions for your platform: [Installation](./installation.md).
* A very brief guide on the main commands you should be familiar with, and an example project to test them in: [Quick Start](./quick-start.md).
* An overview of the Stack Graph, and the framework's main concepts: [The Stack Graph](./stack-graph.md).

If you're already familiar with the basics, feel free to move on to the next chapter: [Using Garden](../using-garden/README.md).

Or dive right in by exploring our [configuration files](../using-garden/configuration-files.md) and [Example Projects](../examples/README.md).
